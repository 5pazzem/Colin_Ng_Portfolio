# Colin's Portfolio

# Project 1: Data Science Salaries
* Created a project to help data scientists estimate salaries, which may help them negotiate
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning Null Values
* Data Visualization with Seaborn
* Machine learning using XGBoost 

# Project 2: Cervical Cancer
* Created a project to detect cervical cancer given biomarkers
